# Parklife Rails example

This is an example of how to use Parklife with a database-backed Rails app.

## Local development

Install the gems:

```
$ bundle install
```

Next, create and seed the SQLite database - I've modified [`db/seeds.rb`](https://github.com/benpickles/parklife/blob/main/examples/rails/db/seeds.rb) so that the standard `rails db:seed` task will populate the database with content from the [`data`](https://github.com/benpickles/parklife/tree/main/examples/rails/data) directory:

```
$ bin/rails db:setup
```

Finally, run the development server:

```
$ bin/rails server
```

## Parklife

Parklife configuration was generated by running `parklife init --rails` which created a [`Parkfile`](https://github.com/benpickles/parklife/blob/main/examples/rails/Parkfile) Parklife configuration file with added Rails integration and a static build script [`bin/static-build`](https://github.com/benpickles/parklife/blob/main/examples/rails/bin/static-build) with some Rails-specific tweaks.
